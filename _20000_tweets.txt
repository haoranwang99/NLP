@Alyssa_Milano Hair loss is not a symptom of COVID-19. It is a symptom of old age! Pretty common when you are in your late 40's and quickly approaching 50. There are treatments, though.
@ntrylo @ElJefe42 @YossiGestetner @Alyssa_Milano N95 means 95% protection! How can you be so dumb? Nothing is full proof but every measure improves your chances! Again, masks are mainly to protect others from your germs. It will protect you from a lot of other people’s germs depending on various factors.

The ADA demands that they offer reasonable accommodation and with online shopping, they do. So you don’t have to shop if you can’t wear a mask.
i also miss the part before lockdown when i practically lived at grooms :((
Just found out i have to print out a form to mail to my gov. to REQUEST a mail in ballot. I only know that bc I signed up to my senator’s newsletter. Not only is this incredibly tedious but it isn’t even advertised to all voters. You expect us to vote in person during a pandemic?

@ChuckCallesto Don’t care about hearing that, I want pay attention until I start hearing recovery rate. If it is less than 99% I would be surprised b/c the deaths currently are over inflated so hospitals get more $ for the cause of death being Covid. Manufactured crisis at this point.

@levinepmc @JustinTrudeau Given the acceptance of the handouts during the early days of the pandemic you are correct. Borrow billions of dollars and spend on the areas outlined.

I get that the players want to play. I respect it, and know that 20 year old Drew would be begging to play. To get it done, the players need to waive liability for any long term issues or unforeseen medical conditions tied to Covid. That's not happening.
A thing I keep forgetting is that despite often getting enough sleep, feeling tired constantly is normal when you are in a looping cycle of grief, stress and anxiety. I have to remind myself that living through a pandemic with absent leadership is just not normal life at all.

@Tequilla_UW I have no clue what this has to do with what I said? I am not complaining about the season being cancelled. That was me trying to plead with idiots to wear a mask so we can even have a chance to watch CFB because I knew if we didn’t stop community spread it won’t happen.

@ChuckCallesto Chinese Coronavirus cases means nothing. Deaths, positive infections, hospitalized patients, patientswho recovered- those matter. Cases is a meaningless statistic used to fear mongering. Do hospitals get more money from the government for reporting more cases?

@Adorable_Todd Fauci has been more wrong than he’s been right on this virus. IMHO, if it weren’t for Fauci, HCQ would’ve been the go-to therapy for Covid-19, possibly saving tens of thousands of lives. His war against a $10 drug vs a $3000 shot, for which he has a financial stake, is criminal.

@Alyssa_Milano Idiot! We learned: The average person loses an average of 50 to 100 hairs from the head every day. You have about 100,000 scalp hairs that follow a predictable cycle of growing (anagen phase), stopping growth (catagen phase) &amp; resting (telogen phase). So, my dog has Covid too?

@DanWolken If they go home, it’ll be only after classes go remote, and it’ll be because they are students. If the schools want to keep the players during a pandemic, they need to compensate them and offer long-term health protections. It isn’t hard, but “amateurism” is a hell of a drug.

If your idea of a “bad virus” is ONLY based off deaths, you’re wrong. I’ve had COVID. Some of the worst few days of my life while my symptoms were still going strong. If you’re only focused on the survival rate then you don’t respect people the way you should.
No one would have to wear a mask if that drugged-out thug, George Floyd, hadn't had a panic attack and uttered those now infamous words, "I can't breathe." So, how about we only have to wear one for 8 minutes and 46 seconds each day?

@GeraldoRivera @realDonaldTrump The covid19 death toll is at over 165k and do you know what Trump is doing right now? He's reaching out to the governor of South Dakota about putting his face on Mount Rushmore. The Geraldo of 40 years ago would have despised Trump. What happened to you?
And I get so irritated and bitter when I see people not following quarantine rules because now folks who ARE following rules have to suffer longer because others can't handle their shit and stay TF inside or god forbid wear a fuckin mask. Like we all hate it. Grow up and do it.
@Alyssa_Milano Why do so called famous people keep getting Covid? Aren't you staying home and wearing a mask?
and now i don’t even do that because we’re in the middle of a pandemic
This is why tying the November presidential vote to the coronavirus could potentially backfire. It could get worse by then, but it's more likely that it will seem like it's going away, and some people will feel like Trump is a prophet.

@Musc96 @theseventhworm Nobody believes the numbers of Covid deaths. The health industry is corrupt as hell and lies about cause of death in order to get more money per head. We also know the tests lie about being positive for Covid. EVERYBODY KNOWS. And they’re mad as hell for being gaslighted.

Trump announced yesterday $400 in extended unemployment benefits per week. How can he do that? 1. Congress allocates money to FEMA for emergency relief. There is some discretion over how money is used. Because covid has been declared a National Disaster, FEMA funds can be used.

They said “we’re going to lose tons of money if we don’t play football." Then some players said “if you make us play in a pandemic we want some of the money from now on.” And suddenly, the season’s off I guess they realized losing one season cost less than paying players forever

@Word_slinger @NealPeterson13 @Alyssa_Milano I have the right to not wear a mask and to pay in cash. Neither your fear nor a fake pandemic (or even a real pandemic) negates that.
The UK has an interesting COVID-19 economic stimulus. Called #EatOutHelpOut, you get 50% off meals eaten at restaurants every week from Monday-Wednesday. The Govt pays the restaurants the 50%, and it encourages people to start patronizing these places again. Coro still dey sha.
@WHO @DrMikeRyan @mvankerkhove #AskWHO I believe 99% of covid-19 infection is caused by inhaling (breathing) aerosol by people not having a face cover (e.g. mask). Otherwise, what are the infection percentages and probabilities by not having a face cover, not hand washing, not having social distance, etc.?

I blame our leaders. I blame the government. I blame the fact, that for the first couple months of this pandemic, our President actively dismissed the threat by suggesting it would not only go away but that it was no worse than the flu.
“Democrats' argument is this is a crisis. This is a pandemic and more money is required. We need the $600, you know, extended into next year via unemployment boost and vastly more money to the states, et cetera, et cetera. ”

I blame this administration for not working on getting the US up to speed with testing, contact tracing and social distancing measures during the initial, partial shutdown (and I blame the half-hearted attempt by many states).

@truthbe53409180 @GovAndyBeshear I know 4 people who have had and still have COVID. The ones who have recovered say it’s worse than any flue they’ve ever had. So clearly you don’t know anyone who’s had it and your just talking out ur ass to express an opinion with no facts.
@palabra_e @ToxicAirsoftGA @Joshuapolk8 @buzzbishop @DeionSanders The difference is one is an infectious virus and the other is an isolated event. One is largely dependent on age and health.

@rootsrockpeter @Oregonian I agree! Although America can un-suck. There’re ways to approach the pandemic seriously if we recognize that it includes curtailing economies to some extent or it could be even worse. If America didn’t suck, we would have a public system (like Sweden!) to cushion this.
@peter_king It doesn’t go away it is just suppressed while we are locked in. As soon as you return to normal it’s there and spreading again. Do you want to lock down forever? Will you get the vaccine?

@DariaMarie_O That's so true! It's hard--we went back to non-zoom classes (limited to &lt;10, distancing, no parents, assigned seats), and honestly it's hard keeping kids apart and not falling into pre-covid joking around/standing close. But it we want to do it, it's important to enforce stuff.

@williamlegate Pandora's Box Bill. Perhaps the reason that @realDonaldTrump doesn't wear a mask is due to the fact that he's physically unable. Is it possible that Trump may possessome sort of respiratory ailment, per chance COPD? Maybe that's why "Wheezy Don" can't wear a mask. @WhiteHouse
@KPeeler17 @KySportsRadio I only saw politicization come from the right once they refused to adhere to social distancing and mask guidelines. Then it became all about rejecting orders because they came from someone you disagree with politically. Both sides are not equally at fault here.

@HRHLou We had the fridge and the oven go at the same time. Mom said the oven wasn’t that big of a deal since she doesn’t use it much, but the fridge was the kicker. Right after COVID started, so we had no choice but to let delivery persons come in the house.

@WayneDupreeShow Not having Covid effects people different ways. It’s science.
@ksatnews What a crock #FakeNews headline. Only 445 deaths when San Antonio averages around 13,000 a year? Quit perpetuating the fear. How many of those 445 actually died from #COVID19 without other underlying condition? Huh?
@riseupmelbourne The response has fictitious results. Lockdowns have been proven to increase deaths and masks do the same because infected people are more likely to die with a mask on. But covid does kill about 0.05%. or we don't trust the count in Sweden?
@maddow @CLRo777 Trump NEVER struggled to fight #COVID19 He ignored it, then downplayed it &amp; used it for political reasons &amp; called it a Dem hoax. The US became the worst on the planet for deaths &amp; cases, by 5x &amp; 30% of cases. Now he’s forcing children back to school to die for reelection.
@sandyaschneider The steaks might have had the China virus.
originally i wanted to go out of state but idk how reasonable that is rn bc of corona and the only reputable surgeons in colorado dont take insurance also im not even allowed to use my parents insurance that im on rn to get it + i cant afford my own insurance hh
@stevalice123 @jamiedupree No Brazil, India or Mexico. No source of the data and no understanding if other countries count COVID deaths equally by factoring in comorbitity. Seems like no reporting is interested in a non political answer to these questions
@anon_delete @Jill23173685 @DavidJHarrisJr @AmericanAir Flu is 80-120nm Corona is 125nm Homemade masks, dust masks, surgical masks WILL NOT protect you from inhaling smaller particles.

Pennsylvania has been a consistent outlier. It regularly reports more Covid deaths than it has excess deaths. I finally got around to diving into the data, expecting skullduggery. What I found was more interesting. Deaths from natural causes dropped when Pa locked down.

@21WIRE They who understood 9/11 false flag terrorism approved of the destruction of Libya. They who understood the destruction of Libya now clap for Covid-19. Perhaps the worst of all this is how the previously "enlightened" so quickly lose their way.
@NorCalSean77 @LABeachGal1 Hard to guess who's behind the protests. We shouldn't forget that the Belarus President refused to bow to the IMF when they threw $960 million at him with stipulation to shut down the country over corona virus. We see this wherever the regimes fail to be their puppet. Modus op.

Enact a mandatory covid lockdown starting on the 17th in DC. We wouldn’t want all these people spreading the virus right? Lock them up before they even get close to the WH for violating lockdown.

@RicoSua70239986 @slevin_heaven @cartierIord @RossDellenger @ByPatForde So no one gets the flu with this vaccine’s or thousand’s still get the flu. Not to mention 150k deaths from flu in 18-19. Covid will be much worse for the elderly but it’s not going anywhere even with a vaccine. We can’t cancel life forever.

I can't just buy at some local store easily because of the lockdown and other reasons, also because online shopping is still a relatively new concept where I live, so there's not that many options.

@SouSouSoukup @Forsolace @writerofwalls @jackdaleydc @chicagosmayor I wouldn't personally make an argument regarding essential and non-essential. COVID doesn't care whether or not you're essential. The point is, if you're in public in close proximity, you are capable of spreading the virus. Treating these two situations different is wrong.

The solution to #COVID is to protect those most in harms way and then let sufficient people catch this to generate immunity and a low R0. This has been the obvious solution for teh observant since February - but #morons like Dan Andrews will not appreciate this.
@ScarletGreatCT We are the only country that has people doing this shit. The rest of the world is moving back to more normalcy and we have people pretending to be scientists out here making the pandemic political. "Not a mask, its a muzzle" crowd are 100% to blame as well with the NCAA

@IAMFBCPA @BillKristol Facts: stubborn things. You can spin it any way Trump tells you to. The truth hurts us all.

However, regardless if the # of new cases was 1, 100, or 1,000, #COVID-19 remains very present in the Coastal Bend. 2 COVID-19 related deaths were reported today by the City of CC-Nueces County Health District. Please do what you can to slow the spread. Be good neighbors.

It's ALL him.

@realDonaldTrump We are currently suffering a terrible economic recession under your leadership! If you had handled COVID better, it could have been past us by now and the economy would be better off. You are costing us money. You are costing us our piece of mind. Killing our savings. #Trump2020

@1980sAppleGuy @Sean_Callahan Legal concern is a component. Players (small %) don’t want a Covid waiver and want all medical costs covered. There are tentacles which have to be considered. College vs HS is about control and travel group size and distance. HS is mostly local, so areas not hard hit might play.
neighbors have 9 ppl in their yard, young naturally, all "huddled" together drinking &amp; eating, no social distancing, One guy picked up some food put it in his friends plate with bare hands! 2 yr old in diapers, no toys, wandering paying no attention-sheesh!
@CoryBooker Good luck getting factual data from those guys, the republican machine is doing its best to askew the data for the “free” citizens much less for the incarcerated in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic.

@realDonaldTrump Dump dictator Trump 2020. Enough lies, self-centeredness, greedy, just for the rich. Down with the dictator, who unlike other presidents, never showed his tax return. Or his famous saying of people who died of covid, it is what it is. A true disgrace of a man.

@Marir65Ruiz @PolitiBunny Yeah, almost as reckless as being the “leader” of the free world and NOT wearing a mask during a pandemic while millions get infected and thousands die. What a fine leader that dumbass you call your president is. He endangers millions with his lack of leadership on this.

@ChrisMWilliams I could've gone about my day mainly social distancing. Rarely were my roommate and I together in the room. I ate alone. Walked to class alone. And it wasn't impossible to get away from people in most of my lectures. Take away the parties, and I was fairly distanced. Doable.

@RapSheet Ugh the NFL hasn’t played a successful season, a preseason, a team on team practice, and one NFL game during Covid19. Think you’re getting way ahead yourself. The NFL playing in non bubble is taking the chance to be MLB2, a joke of a season where star players could be out.

@Dr_Nate_Corzine It’s nuts. The Pirates have already played 11 more games. I doubt, too, that the Cards will be the last team with an outbreak (Plesac/Cleveland).
@alexcutler247 @SportsCenter What "safety procedures"??? Be specific... What procedures can keep 60 players on a team safe from a contagious, viral pandemic?? Would you put your 18-21 year old on the field??? I doubt it... Admit it, this pandemic is kicking our ass.
Why dont you increase bus services to promote social distancing, especially for routes like the 39 buses, huh @TTChelps ? been waiting for over 20 minutes and it's already packed with people... #TTC https://t.co/O2sjCh2UXG
@ClayTravis College kids are not more likely to die from the flu. You keep repeating this lie like trump. Managing this risk is done by not being in close contact with people that may have contracted it. It’s called social distancing which can’t be done playing football

Using SALT as leverage in the current negotiations is unconscionable.
@theonetheonlyn8 @AllanBell247 Also, there’s still no proof that having had COVID-19 once makes you immune to it for life. There is strong evidence that the anti-body levels in COVID-19 survivors drops dramatically over time. Also, a new strain of the virus may appear, making herd immunity impossible. 3/3

@chrismedina Sure but part of the reason for this is that the NFL and NFLPA have a deal where players are compensated so they take on risk. In the NCAA, players aren't willing to take on said risk due to lack of compensation amidst the pandemic. And NCAA can't reduce the risk as NFL did.
@laurawritesit @Aztec4Life13 Again, if you can’t breathe in a mask that doctors, nurses, window cleaners, construction workers and visitors to hospitals safely wear every day, you should probably be avoiding public places during a pandemic as you are medically fragile.
@Alyssa_Milano How about YOU not wear a crocheted mask twit. I think it is just a symptom of Trump Derangement Syndrome. Or you are just getting old.
@CovfefeAnon @DarrenJBeattie Honestly, Sweden seems the closest thing to a point the skeptics have. In summary, they've done better than ppl thought they would with a significantly lighter lockdown. Their experience may well say critical things about herd immunity. I don't think it's necessarily a model tho.

@ThatRayShow @Alyssa_Milano She probably was. Masks don’t protect you from getting the virus. They lessen the chance of you giving it to others. I’m guessing she didn’t bother washing her hands or social distancing because she had a mask. But it’s all our fault for not protecting her and her precious hair.

@MarcTennant @Jackthelad1947 @sallymcmanus @MichaelColl5 What actually happened was, the first wave Spanish flu, killed mainly elderly and weak, second wave the virus mutation meant it killed everyone pretty much equally, but generally this doesn't happen, virus often become weaker, it's very rare.

@scotts_3101 @Alyssa_Milano Idiot! We learned: The average person loses an average of 50 to 100 hairs from the head every day. You have about 100,000 scalp hairs that follow a predictable cycle of growing (anagen phase), stopping growth (catagen phase) &amp; resting (telogen phase). So, my dog has Covid too?

@analogfusion Right! This feels very intentional to pander to a certain demographic. My sister wonders if it's an election year for him Btw, someone my sister went to school with and is in his mid-40s is hospitalized with Covid, but he lives in a different state. He was a Covid denier too
Hi @StevenStackMD I cannot wait for my pinned tweet to go viral. My my has your narrative changed from early April? Masks were a distraction then but now they’re the single most important thing we can do huh? Your political career is done after covid is contained. Selfish liar.
@drdavidsamadi And what about those who died bc Covid patients were put in their nursing homes. This act alone drove up numbers in 5 states.

@Shauncore CDC’s best estimate infection fatality rate was .26% in May. More papers from other countries have echoed anywhere from .21-.28% iFR. You cannot simply take the deaths divided by cases. And the vast majority of those are over 65 and/or with comorbidities.

@AnotherSFwriter @darrenrovell Whos arguing not to stay home when its possible &amp; wear a mask? But if players are being tested regularly&amp; theres a controlled environment w/out fans, the risks are the same if not less than being home. Greater chances at home of being asymptomatic &amp;being around those at high risk
@DK_Thompson Yes thats what proximate causation is in simple terms. Is it foreseeable that if they allow these games to be played that players will catch covid. If it is and they catch it from games/practices, thats legal causation.

@marcorubio Eyeroll. We have a president who called your father a traitor, lies to America daily, killed Americans with inaction to COVID, sells out US to Putin, betrayed Kurds, puts kids in cages—and you don't know what to do. Rubio gave up. He surrendered to his own bully.

@insomnochick @insomnochick Do you acknowledge that your expectation for a declining coronavirus death rate in the US was incorrect? My expectation was that it would rise more than it did.

@cyclicAMP24 oh man 2020 robbed us all. I was supposed to go back to Japan for several weeks this spring, visited in 2017 and was so glad I went. I love that high puffy bread you can get in Japan and Korea. I made lots of sourdough under lockdown, first time I didn't kill a starter!
An interesting personal observation when wear in a mask: after removing the mask, smells seem more intense for brief period of time.
with covid on the scene, no infrastructure in place for locals stuck abroad to vote is rel failure

@brownbear575 @Anonymo50285227 @ChuckGrover7 @murray_nyc @realDonaldTrump Then there's this. We'll forgo 2020 and 2016 as they're election years and well, the pandemic. So, in 2015, the deficit was $442 billion, or 2.4% of GDP. In 2019, the deficit was $984 billion, or 4.6% of GDP. Kind of kills that 0.5% GDP offset. A "far superior" economy you say?

@peter_king If it’s your contention that increased mask usage and stricter shelter in place regulations would eliminate the virus I would recommend studying how viruses like COVID-19 actually spread. The truth is most people in our country have sacrificed a lot over the last 5 months.
@heretodestroy I found the first 2 months of the pandemic taxing on my mental health, I still have moments of dispare, but overall, the moments of inner peace of sitting on the deck with a good book to read and hummingbirds jousting around me have filled me with joy more than expected.
@KCDawg34 @tired_fighting @changermindset @RepThomasMassie And yet most people in this nation, until the covid paranoia, were living better lives than many parts of the world. Destroying billionaires to give our useless government more money to waste accomplishes nothing.

I am honestly wondering. Is it the fact that those players will be under a more watchful eye on campus and held to social distancing?
@chrismedina I think they share a part of the blame but the fact there's players who are essentially saying they won't play w/out meeting demands in the pandemic (including pay) indicates a truth. Season cancelled=lost revenue Pay players=way more lost revenue forever

@chicagosmayor This shows how many people don't know definitions. Pandemic: wide geographic area and affecting an exceptionally high proportion of the population. Epidemic: disproportionately large number of individuals in a population/region at the same time. Typhoid was an epidemic.

@ovo_ej Any reasonable person would. It's not hard to stay home, wear a mask, and keep 6ft distance from others. The reality is that every player on a football team will be exposed more if they play and travel. They would be exposed less at home. That's a fact.
A shearing contactor who lives in my town had a worker go to Melbourne for a holiday before lockdown. They demanded that the worker get back here for work. Someone found out about it. They got on a plane to Perth and were met by the Federal police and army and put in quarantine.

@ftivanmont @zaphosnz @spookyskeltals @seaking4steel @NetHistorian The freer the country is the worse it will do during a pandemic.
@thienpham_ In a way it makes sense. It is a lot easier to manage with a population of 5 million. We have very little population density here. There are other countries that have done it better. We are just very lucky here that we had so many people respectful of lockdown regulations.
@vin30leixlip @josephamadigan This will not happen in Ireland because large class sizes mean a part time schooling, possibly as low as 1-2 days a week. This, and only this, is why Norma and friends insist on the falsehood that children present a low acquisition and transmission risk with covid.

@NYchatbox0718 having college football will only further elongate the pandemic.
@lazizery @PeteBlackburn @dwass34 @bofffsauce Lets throw in 2 more games to encompass crow's full playin round. Crow has an 829 and 862 and Lehner has 864 and 1000(both came before shutdown). I'm still taking RL. Don't be upset at him just cause your team had no shot at the playoffs and sold before the pandemic.

@tturnt1 @Jacks455 @JoeBiden It shows a rise in GDP. Especially in the one month data, all except for the sudden drop during the offset of the pandemic. But it rose back up again, and if you extend the data you'll see that it continues to rise.

@MLBONFOX This is why we can't have nice things, especially during COVID.

Real talk though: it’s been 19 days since my test. That’s a pathetic response time and renders it utterly useless. Also doesn’t mean I’m immune. Moral of the story: if you test negative, continue to wear a mask and physically distance yourself when going out.
@seattletimes CORRECTION: Numerous lies are building to brainwash people to believe they need masks. https://t.co/k0ymzCOjq3
@AaronNagler I am very curious to know how some institutions will change long term coming out of this COVID crisis.
@SeemaCMS Nursing Home visitation policy is outrageous. It violates resident &amp; family rights. It is cruel &amp; inhuman. It is elder abuse. PPE &amp; Covid testing of family members should be criteria. Isolation, loneliness &amp; despair kill too

@WilliamJoy Here’s why athletes are not enthusiastic to catch Covid: it’s potentially a career-ender. A well paid career that leads to a less than ordinary life. We’re learning that Covid’s neurological, cardiovascular, &amp; overall damage to the lungs can either be permanent or long-lasting.
@TexasFancyBoots I've been convinced for weeks there's not going to be a season. The AD's have been consistent for weeks, nobody knows how to do this right, and the pandemic isn't getting any better. After the MAC announcement today, I'm pretty certain it's a forgone conclusion.
@Lews_aPatriot @DEPLORABLEREEG1 @JimSooner @JoeBiden It's not all his fault, but he's doing everything possible to dismantle Obamacare without a replacement, and still doesn't have a health care plan 3.5 years into his presidency. That's on him. The Coronavirus clusterfuck is a national failure of national leadership. That's Trump

At this point, there are too many ppl I know who have had Covid and they just go back out without masks when they are well again. That’s happening now and will be the future. I mean, rn a friend who just recovered, is back on a sailboat unmasked with a group.

This is an example of the thinking that has hampered our response to COVID in the USA. I WANT the pandemic to be over, but it is not in the best interest of my community to act like it is.

@kelly_j_baker I told Aimée about this lady at my school who is just UGH ... and I can guarantee you she is going to give me shit for being in bed in my pyjamas. It’s a pandemic. I just had surgery. I’m sick. She also told me that I basically should just drop out so this should be interesting.
Dr. Fauci welcomes Trump's more sober tone on COVID-19: 'He's adjusting to reality of what's happening' https://t.co/gTKQ7tdzTI
@TheStakeClerk We don’t wear it over our nose because we don’t want to wear it at all and don’t care what it covers. As you can see society just cares there’s a mask on and not whether it is effective or not.
We made our bed with covid. We could have gotten rid of it months ago. We could have taken it seriously. Now we can't stand the consequences of our actions because we may not have sports or school. This should open your eyes to take things seriously.
@bartonsimmons It’s not about player safety, it’s about liability/optics. It’s dumb but it is what it is. Players aren’t less likely to get Covid if they aren’t playing football but the school/conference is less likely to get blamed.
@Kernpuff @frankie_1987 It’s devastating, I’ll never forget when all this first started and my nanna saying she didn’t mind not getting her pacemaker tested at that point because at least if it gave out it’d be a quicker and less painful death than if she caught Covid

@BassiriGharb @RC_Epi @EricBlake12 So let’s eliminate post production! We did that with a lot of broadcast TV due to COVID and it’s mostly fine. I sense people care about production value just enough and most modern word processors pass that bar. Do we save enough to hire that undergrad?

@JoiofMovement @axios Not really. NZ has four million people. Any leader with half a brain could have achieved this. It's disgusting how China knew COVID-19 was transmissible through humans and (1) lied about it, and (2) deliberately sent 50 million Chinese nationals to infect Western Europe.

@GOP @realDonaldTrump @Mike_Pence No, they don't. They stand for birth &amp; Trump really doesn't care. They care nothing about life as is evidenced by their lack of concern about the deaths from COVID-19, the kids on the border, the failure to address gun violence, and the push to send children back to school.

@bueller_tom @abcnews I won't pray upon anyone to get #COVID19, let alone dying of it. One can get better enough to be ready to be discharged from hospo, but die next day. How do I know? We lost a loved one to #COVID19 in our family. The best way to not die, is by not getting it in the first place.
Lemme get this straight... Per @seattletimes, Super. Harold Olin of Idiana school where a #covid positive kid came on day 1 says "We felt like we were at a good place to start school &amp; then, through no fault of our own, a kid comes to school who shouldn’t have been there." (1/3)
And it's the best COVID sport for sure and holy fuck it's not even close. It's certainly easier to manage/create an environment in an arena than it is a stadium.
